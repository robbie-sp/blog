# robbie-sp.github.io
Rob's blog

A blog built with static site generator [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com).

Once cloned, blog can be built (see output folder) by running:

```bash
cd site
pelican content
```

GitHub pages automatically picks up website at user-name.github.io so blog output is copied to separate [repository](https://github.com/robbie-sp/robbie-sp.github.io) for publishing. (There are other ways to do this that may be more efficient.)
